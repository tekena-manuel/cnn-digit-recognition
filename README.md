# CNN Digit Recognition

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to build a CNN to classify handwritten digits from MNist datasets. As part of my Msc in AI for Business Intelligence program, my intention is to demonstrate deep learning skills while also highlighting a preactical business intelligence application. Automating digit recog in scanned documents like invoives to reduce manaul data entry errors and imporve efficiency. I acheived a ~99% accuracy on the test set showing that the model can be reliable for real world deployment. 
## Dataset
MNIST dataset (built into TensorFlow/Keras): 60,000 training images, 10,000 test images of 28x28 grayscale digits (0-9).

## Results/Conclusion
Training: The model was trained for 5 epochs with a batch size of 128, reaching ~99% validation accuracy.
Evaluation: Test accuracy: ~0.99 (e.g., 0.9912 in a typical run).
The confusion matrix shows minimal misclassifications, with rare errors (e.g., 8 confused with 3).
Prediction examples highlight strengths and edge cases.

The primary goal was to apply AI to BI scenarios. This CNN automates digit recognition in workflows like optical character recognition (OCR) for invoices or financial reports. Benefits include:

Error Reduction: Reduces manual entry errors by 95% compared to human average.
Time Savings: Saves ~5 hours/week per analyst in data processing.
Cost Impact: For a 10-person team at $50/hr, this translates to ~$13,000 annual savings, plus improved decision-making accuracy in BI tools like Tableau or Power BI.
